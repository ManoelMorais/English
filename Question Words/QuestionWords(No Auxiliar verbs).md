# Question Words No Auxiliary Verbs

- Question: Who made the wedding cake?
- Answer: Anne made the wedding cake

When we have a interrogative sentence with one of these question words: What, Who, Which or Whose, and its answer is the subject of the sentence, we don't need to use the auxiliary verbs "does", "do" or "did" to indicate the question

- E.g:
  - What fell off the bridge?
  - My car fell off the bridge
