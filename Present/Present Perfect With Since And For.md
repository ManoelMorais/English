# Present Perfect With Since And For

- **Since**
  - We use "since" to mark the beginning of an activity in a specific point in time or the specific moment of an action. This activity haooebs in the present
    - E.g: Ted hasn't smoked since 2010
    - I have lodev you since the first time I met you

- **For**
  - We use "for" to refer to the duration of an activity, but it does not necessarily infer that this activity still happens in the present
    - E.g: I haven't seen my brother for weeks
    - She has studied in London for 2 years
