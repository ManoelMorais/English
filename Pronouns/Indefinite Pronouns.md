# Indefinite Pronouns

We use indefinite pronouns to refer to people or things without saying exactly who or what they are

We use pronouns ending in "body" or "one" for people, and pronouns ending in "thing" for things:

| Quantidade |  |  |  | Ao que se refere |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Anybody    | Everybody | Nobody    | Somebody  | People    |
| Anyone     | Everyone  | No one    | Someone   | People    |
| Anything   | Everything| Nothing   | Something | Thing     |

- **Rule 1**: After on indefinite pronoun, conjugate the verb in the singular
  - E.g: Everybody loves Sally
  - Everything was ready for the party
- **Rule 2**: When we use an indefinite pronouns in a sentence and make a reference to it in a subsequent one, we normally use a plural pronoun
  - E.g: Everybody enjoyed the concert. They stood up and clapped
  - Everyone is talking about her. They think her soeech was really impressive
  - Is this anybody's wallet
- **Rule 3**: It's possible to add "s" to on indefinite pronoun to make a possessive
  - E.g: They were having fusn at somebody's party
  - Is this anybody's wallet?
- **Rule 4**: We use "else" after indefinite pronouns to refer to other people or things
  - E.g: My parents come to my graduation, but no one else
  - If it doesn't work, try something else

***

- OBS-1: In a negative context, use indefinite pronouns with "no", not indefinite pronouns with "any"
  - E.g: Correct: Nobody come --> Incorrect: Anybody didn't come
- OBS-2: In negative sentences, do not use the indefinite pronouns "nobody", "no one" or "nothing"
  - E.g: Correct: Nothing happened --> Incorrect: Nothing didn't happen
